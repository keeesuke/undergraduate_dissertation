This repository is for my undergraduate reserch about "Contributors to the stability of retained austenite in low alloy TRIP steel using machine learning"

The main files of code for analysis are:  
Setting constant valiable
<li>const.py</li>
preprocessing
<li>all_to_be_the_same_size.ipynb</li>
<li>distorted_auto-detection_for_py.ipynb</li>
integrate all features to make csv files
